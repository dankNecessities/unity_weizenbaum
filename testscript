//Note:
// 1. The format has been slightly changed such that the numbers in the reassembly rules refer to which of the zeroes is 
// referenced e.g. for D-Rule: (0 do I remember 0), R-Rule: (Did you think I would forget 2) means insert the second 
// zero's contents. 
// 2. Every script must begin with START.
// 3. Equivalence classes must be defined before they can be used by keywords.
// 4. Rules pertaining to a certain keyword must be defined before the next keyword is defined.
// 5. The parent decomposition rule for a reassembly rule is the last defined decomposition rule.
