//Note:
// 1. The format has been slightly changed such that the numbers in the reassembly rules refer to which of the zeroes is 
// referenced e.g. for Decomposition Rule: (0 do I remember 0), Reassembly Rule: (Did you think I would forget 2) means // insert the second zero's contents. 
// 2. Every script must begin with START.
// 3. Equivalence classes must be defined before they can be used by keywords.
// 4. Rules pertaining to a certain keyword must be defined before the next keyword is defined.
// 5. The parent decomposition rule for a reassembly rule is the last defined decomposition rule.
// 6. If the specifier 'copy' is used before a decomposition rule, then the reassembly rules attached to the previous  // rule are copied.
// 7. None is used as the equivalence class for situations when no keyword is found.
// 8. Equivalence Classes pair a set of keywords to a set of decomposition rules while Dlists pair a set of keywords to  // a single equivalence class.
